Merge LoadImageStack and LoadImages, Stack version if for the final exportation stage.
Crash error after applying plate and scrolling the top-to-bottom view
plate line sometimes black (multi tray), check colour space
Some say the CSV window doesn't always appear, test 
Handle Error when a user cancels on the CSV load
If could store the first and last value when plating, could have grid appear over full image
Export tiff stack refactor method too messy
# todo add plate warning when no cel
# check what happens to the file after excel
if multiplates the crops are not correct, on plating maybe auto export to multiple stacks, check lines 505 and 462 most likely error
adding plating in seperate stacks causes error in console
